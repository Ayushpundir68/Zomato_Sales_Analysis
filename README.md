# Zomato_Sales_Analysis
This project analyzes Zomato's sales data using Power BI, uncovering key insights on revenue, customer behavior, and trends. I cleaned and transformed data, identified top-selling restaurants, analyzed, peak order times, and payment methods, and built an interactive dashboard for better decision-making.

 Introduction:
 
Zomato is a global restaurant discovery and food delivery platform that provides information, menus, and reviews for restaurants. The dataset contains details about various restaurants, including their location, cuisines offered, average cost for two people, ratings, votes, and whether they offer table booking and online delivery services.

 Analysis of Zomato Data:
 
- Country-wise Restaurant Distribution and Ratings:
From the analysis, it is evident that some countries, such as the UAE and New Zealand, have a higher concentration of restaurants with better average ratings compared to others like India. Countries like the Philippines and Indonesia also feature highly rated restaurants.

- City-wise Cost Analysis:
The cities with the highest average cost for dining are Panchkula, Hyderabad, and Pune. Panchkula stands out with an average cost of ₹2000 for two, which is significantly higher than other cities. This indicates that high-end dining is prominent in certain locations.

- Impact of Online Delivery and Table Booking:
Restaurants offering table booking and online delivery options tend to receive more votes and better ratings. About 88% of the restaurants in the dataset allow table bookings, and a significant portion of these have higher customer engagement.
 
 Proposed Solutions and Insights:
 
Based on the data analysis:

- Expanding online delivery services in cities where it is less common could potentially increase customer engagement and ratings.

- Encouraging restaurants to implement table booking services may also enhance their ratings and customer feedback.

- Restaurants in high-cost cities should focus on premium services to justify their pricing, as customer expectations may be higher.

 Conclusion:
 
The dataset provides comprehensive insights into customer preferences across different cities and countries. Restaurants with online delivery and table booking services tend to perform better in terms of customer ratings and votes. The analysis reveals key trends in pricing, customer engagement, and service offerings, which can help Zomato improve its platform by recommending best practices to restaurants.
